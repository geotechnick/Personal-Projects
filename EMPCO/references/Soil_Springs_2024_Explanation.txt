Soil Springs_2024.xlsx Analysis

Sheet Names:
- Input&Summary
- Calcs

Sheet: Input&Summary
- Appears to contain summary information and input parameters for soil spring calculations.
- First visible entries: None, RIGHT BANK (likely a header or section marker).
- The sheet likely includes tables for user input (e.g., soil properties, geometry, bank type) and summary results.

Sheet: Calcs
- Appears to contain calculation details, starting with: None, Axial Forces (likely a header or section marker).
- This sheet likely includes tables for calculated forces, spring constants, and other engineering outputs.
- Formulas in this sheet would typically reference input values from 'Input&Summary' and perform engineering calculations (e.g., axial force, spring rate, displacement).

How the Excel Works:
1. User enters site-specific data and soil parameters in 'Input&Summary'.
2. The sheet summarizes key input values and may provide a quick overview of the bank type (e.g., RIGHT BANK).
3. 'Calcs' uses these inputs to compute soil spring properties, axial forces, and other relevant engineering metrics using embedded formulas.
4. Results are presented in tables for review and further analysis.

To extract formulas:
- Use Excel's formula view (Ctrl+` in Excel) or inspect individual cells for formulas.
- Formulas will typically use references like =A2*B2, =SUM(...), or more complex engineering equations.

To extract tables:
- Copy and paste table ranges from Excel to a text file, or use Python (e.g., xlwings, pandas) to export ranges as CSV or TXT.

Note: This summary is based on the sheet structure and typical engineering workflow. For a full list of formulas and table contents, open the file in Excel and inspect each sheet, or use Python to programmatically extract cell formulas and values.
