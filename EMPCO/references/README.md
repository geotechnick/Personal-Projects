- **Engineering Review**: Automated results should always be validated against these reference standards

## üîó Integration with Automated System

The automated analysis system implements methodologies from these references:

- **Factor of Safety thresholds** based on bank stability manual recommendations
- **Soil springs calculations** validated against Appendix B procedures
- **Decision matrix logic** aligned with industry standard practices
- **Pipeline stress analysis** following ASCE guidelines

## üìñ For Developers

When modifying the automated system:

1. **Consult relevant reference documents** for engineering context
2. **Validate changes** against established procedures  
3. **Maintain consistency** with industry standards
4. **Document deviations** from reference methodologies

These references ensure the automated system maintains engineering accuracy and follows established industry practices.
